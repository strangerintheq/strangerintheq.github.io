The essence of the Tentura's work is that it breaks the connection
between the body and soul of every living being under its influence.

The subject becomes bound to a global variable, which is calculated
and controlled by the Tentura itself.

To understand this, you can use the metaphor of virtual reality.

A person starts a computer game and takes control of a character.

The character acts under the influence of the player's will.

In this case, the player personifies the character in its entirety -
the soul (various game-mechanical characteristics) and the body
(the image on the screen).

The set of rules of the game symbolize the material world with its rigidly defined laws.

Imagine that at some point a third-party program turns off the player's
input means and begins to control the character itself, calculating his
next actions according to some internal algorithms.

In this case, the events taking place with the character are no longer determined
by the will of the player or the rules of the game itself, but by a ready-made plot
which was previously written by someone or generated by the third-party program itself.

This is the work of Tentura, with the amendment that the object of its control is reality.
