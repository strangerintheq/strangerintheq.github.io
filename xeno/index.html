        **Xeno** - is a journey into the unseen worlds of distant star systems. Breathtaking and colorful, dark and
        frightening. Extraterrestrial landscapes and natural phenomena, traces of extraterrestrial life and minerals,
        mountains and coastlines, sunsets and sunrises - just to name a few. I have named all the palettes according to
        the names of the nearest star systems.

        This adventure began in early 2023, in January I created a custom library for the Genuary challenge with which I
        built one of the first "Xeno" prototypes. Over the next months, intermittently, I made about ten approaches to
        this algorithm and got some pretty interesting results everywhere, with all of these experiments done on my
        phone. Then it was time to turn it into a single work, I got my thoughts together, transferred all the
        developments to my laptop and selected the best in my opinion from all the past attempts.

        Most of the work is done on the fragment shader and the simplex noise, which is used here and there in the
        shader code. This is one of the most complex shaders I've done so far, some things are quite hard to control, so
        I'm very happy with the result.
